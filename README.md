# CrowdCraft
Crowdsourced AR experience
I started this project to try to create an AR experience that would allow users to build geo-referenced structures and allow other users to see the structures in the proper geographic context. While the prototype can locate an object geographically, the inherent drift in location systems makes it difficult to keep the virtual creations stable in the field of view.
